<h1>Welcome to our JQM Adventure!</h1>

First things first, let's get in sync with our partner and pick a tool to communicate. To keep things organized, each week one of us will be the "project leader" and make sure all the meetings and communications are on track. Then, we'll alternate the role every week. This team is meant to last for all future homeworks and projects, so let's make it count!

But wait, what if our partner goes MIA? No worries! Just cc the instructor on all emails and they'll jump in to make sure everyone is pulling their weight.

Now, let's dive into the project! Our instructor has given us a starter project (FirstJQM.zip) and here's what we need to do:

Brainstorm a theme for our website. What will it do and what's its purpose?

Using images, text, and CSS, let's make the home page as attractive and descriptive as possible.

Time to get creative! We need to transform the "add" and "subtract" pages into something more interesting and useful. Make sure it supports the theme of our website. Our instructor's pages had just 5 lines of HTML in the "content" section, but we need to up our game with at least 15 lines. The JavaScript only added or subtracted 2 numbers, but we need to make it do something more exciting.

We can choose to be adventurous and go all out or keep it simple for a decent grade. If we're not sure what to do, just shoot an email to the instructor with our planned theme and functionality and they'll give us the green light.

Finally, let's submit a link to our GitHub repo and let the world see our creation!
